This is one of the first websites I ever created as part of a team.

In order to view the website please run the commands below in your respective terminal.

**npm install**

and then

**npm run dev**

Within terminal please click on 'http://localhost:3000'

Due to current and ongoing preference for mobile first designs this website was made with mobile first in mind so please 
put the website into mobile first mode.

To put a website into mobile first mode just do a right hand click in browser and click on inspect. 
You can choose mobile option of preference.


This Project was a team effort.

- My focus was on linking webpages and compiling the founders page meaning I focused on jsx and CSS.

For future:

- Our team would like to make sure all aspects of our form are regex controlled and add links to the submit page for ease of return to main page.
